🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
📘 Overview
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis project designed to monitor and visualize global COVID-19 trends. It focuses on analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates across countries over time. The project leverages real-world datasets and Python's data analysis libraries to provide insightful visualizations and narratives.

🎯 Objectives
Import and clean global COVID-19 datasets.

Analyze temporal trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

Compare key metrics across different countries and regions.

Visualize trends using charts and maps.

Communicate findings effectively in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.
